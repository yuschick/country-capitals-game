# Country Capitals Game
Simple. A country will be displayed and you must guess its capital city. Right or wrong, you will at least be met with a suitably entertaining gif. This project was built at The Iron Yard in Durham, NC as an in-class project that reenforced module patterns and introduced simple `XMLHttpRequests` to public APIs.
